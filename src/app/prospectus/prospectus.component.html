                        As we all know, education has the biggest roleplay in a
                        child's upbringing, which starts from a very tender age of a
                        child. So Blooming Buds School, Gossaigaon was started with
                        a very pure and sole idea of providing a quality education with
                        pleasant surroundings to children. "The Utmost For The Highest"
                        being the motto of the school, we surely guide the students with
                        utmost care to give their very best academically and also along with
                        that, we focus on growing a child morally fit to live a better tomorrow
                        with the highest level of confidence and commitments to reach their
                        goal and grow up to be a better individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At B.B.S. Gossaigaon a child is exposed to all kinds of academic and
                        non-academic surroundings where he/she gets a wide opportunity to
                        craft their skills and grow a leadership quality in them. The school team
                        always try to find innovative ways to maximize the learning potential of the
                        students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to do this, we need your support. The challenge for us together is to
                        fund our ambitions.
